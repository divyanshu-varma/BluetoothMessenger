# BluetoothMessenger
BluetoothMessenger is like WhatsApp, but it runs on Bluetooth!
Since it runs on Bluetooth, it can be used in basements, or in areas without cell network. Internally, one device acts as a client and the other as a server, and messages are exchanged between the two.

Current limitations include support for two devices only, and text messages only.
